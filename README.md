# marchmadness
This repository contains copies of a project I did attempting to forecast the success of different march madness teams using performance in previous years. \
This work was originally undertaken as part of a project for Statistics 201: Statistics & Data Analysis at Williams College in spring 2019. \
Unfortunately the original files have been deleted, and so only these pdf copies remain. \
Contained in this repository are both the original code and the written analysis submission.
